        <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p style="margin: 10px;">Super Minecraft Servers is the homepage for the best Minecraft servers around! The servers shown here are all hosted and managed by the same team (and you can learn more about us below!) When we needed a generic name to keep track of all our code repositories, accounts, and more related to our servers - Super Minecraft Servers was born. It's our team name and it's what we do!</p>

        <h3>What do we do?</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px;">We specialize in running semi-vanilla and vanilla+ servers that provide a unique survival experience that players new and old can all enjoy. All of the servers you see promoted on this website are hosted and managed by us! Each server offers something different, so you can find the right survival experience for you. No matter what, though, we promise a stable, lag-free, and reliable server with excellent moderators and a great community. This is one thing all of our servers have in common.</p>

        <h3>Hosting</h3>
        <p style="margin: 10px;">Our servers are self-hosted on a Ryzen 5 5600G with 64GB RAM, 3TB SSD storage, and a 500Mbps fiber network. They also have backup power to keep things online during brief outages. We take daily backups of our servers and keep all our configurations in version control.</p>
        <p style="margin: 10px;">We use publicly available community made plugins when available, and customize them or write plugins from scratch when we want to do something that public plugins don't offer. Right now, about half of our plugins are custom written.</p>
